Source code for a Movie Trailer website.

Code and HTML file are public at https://github.com/Decnop/ud036_StarterCode

There is more than one way to execute the Movie Trailer Website:

1) Open the fresh_tomatoes.html file with a browser.

2) Download and Install Python 2.7(https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/). In the same folder, put the fresh_tomatoes.pyand main.py files. Open main.py with Python 2.7. Run(F5) the file.

3) Run main.py file, if fresh_tomatoes is compiled.

Sorry for my english.

I tried to shorten url for images but i didn´t find out how.
